                After analyzing the provided data and statistics, I realized that almost all students, senior officials, and employees working in the corporate sector as well as interested fellows who have dedicated themselves to learning web development, and tech language and enhancing their coding skills should have a website which they can follow. First of all, this is an attempt for the users to enhance their quick problem-solving skills and amplify their practical mindset. In addition, the website will provide the users with a better opportunity to update given materials. Also, it will be a safe gateway to enter the internet. Furthermore, some renowned universities have shown interest to attach study materials and modules on the website so that users can use, learn and download them whenever they want as per their needs.
This is a website that is used for designing effective programming language courses such as C, Python, and Java.
